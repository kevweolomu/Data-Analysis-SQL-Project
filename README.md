# Data-Analysis-SQL-Project

This project was focused on utilising Python, SQL and PowerBI.

The dataset used for this project was the World Happiness Report Dataset for 2019 and 2020.

The skills gained during this project:
  - SQL
    - aggregate functions such as avg, count, min and max,
    - group by,
    - case when,
    - inner joins, and
    - order by.
    
 - PowerBI
    - Dashboard creation 
      - using python scripts to create positive and negative correlation graphs for the 2019 dataset
      - scatterplot showing 3 clusters of countries with similar trends
    
 - Python
    - pandas and numpy for basic analysis of the 2019 data set
    - matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn to plot correlation graphs
    - sklearn.model_selection for train and test splits
    - sklearn.linear_model for linear regression
    - sklearn.metrics for mean_absolute_error and r2_score
    - sklearn.preprocessing for StandardScaler which standardises a feature by subtracting the mean and         then scaling to unit variance.
    - sklearn.cluster KMeans 
    - yellowbrick.cluster for KElbowVisualizer implements the "elbow" method of selecting the
      optimal number of clusters for K-means clustering
    - collections for Counter used to output the cluster size of each cluster in k-means clustering 

The tools used in this project include:
  - MySQL, 
  - Excel, 
  - PowerBI, 
  - Jupyter notebook (Google Collab)
